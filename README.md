# YoutubeClone

# Purpose 
I would like to share my recent project involving the development of a YouTube web application through the utilization of RapidAPI, Material UI, and React. This endeavor allowed me to understand better API functionality and how data is fetched from the internet, enabling our server to perform tasks such as retrieving information on YouTube videos. Additionally, it provided me with a more comprehensive comprehension of the React framework, particularly in relation to route communication, navigation, and page and route transferal in line with modern web standards. Through the use of Material UI, I have also enhanced my knowledge of essential features such as useEffect and CSS properties.
Creating this project was a challenging experience, particularly regarding the usage of Material UI, which encompasses a significant amount of CSS and native MUI bars. This necessitated considerable reading and documentation analysis to gain a more thorough understanding. Furthermore, the proper use of the API proved to be a challenge, as I was still in the process of fully comprehending its input requirements, which may require further study and documentation analysis.
In summary, this project has provided me with a valuable opportunity to learn more about front-end development.
In terms of the project structure, I utilized the YouTube-v38 API to fetch data by implementing functions such as searching by category or ID. The default sidebar was modified by rewriting some categories such as "code, podcast, music," and clicking on these categories grants access to their respective videos, complete with information such as title and channel title. Clicking on a video's small bar allows users to enter the watch page, view the video using <ReactPlayer />, and display all related videos. Finally, a search function is available through a search bar at the top of the page.
If you have any more questions, please feel free to let me know. A brief video demonstrating the project is also available upon request.
